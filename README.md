# docker-php
This is my private PHP base image in order to be up-to-date with latest Apache AND PHP versions. The image includes many PHP extensions enabled
by default so most PHP applications can run without much tweaks. Check the [Dockerfile] to see the list of PHP extensions.

# License
All scripts are either taken from PHP original Docker image and adapted to work with the latest Apache or created on my own. However, the main
credit goes to PHP and its prior work. The [PHP LICENSE](PHP_LICENSE.txt) is distributed here.

# Disclaimer
The decision to publish my base image was taken in July 2021. That's why the documentation is currently missing or incomplete. Also: there is
no public image yet available directly at Docker Hub. This will follow soon. Meanwhile, you can recreate the image from this repo.
